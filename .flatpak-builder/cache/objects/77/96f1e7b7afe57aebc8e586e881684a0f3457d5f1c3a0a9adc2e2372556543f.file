title: Install Grapejuice on Ubuntu 18.04 and similar distributions
---
## Preamble

‚ùì If you didn't click on the guide for Ubuntu 18.04, but ended up on this page regardless, please do not panic! Ubuntu
18.04 is a distribution that is similar enough to other distributions in the Linux landscape. This guide is applicable
to the following distributions:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)
- Zorin OS 15.2
- Linux Mint 19.3 (Tricia)

---

üíª All commands in this guide should be run in a terminal emulator using a regular user account that has access to `su`
or `sudo`. If you are running a fully fledged desktop environment, you can find a terminal emulator in your applications
menu.

‚≠ê Some commands do not produce any output. This usually means that the command ran successfully, so don't worry!

## Enabling 32-bit support

Even though Roblox Studio runs in 64-bit mode, 32-bit libraries are still required for some parts of the program. This
is due to backwards compatibility in the Windows operating system. Run the following command in a terminal:

```sh
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
```

## Install FAudio

FAudio audio libraries are not supplied by the Ubuntu repositories, so we will have to install these manually.

**01:** Download the FAudio packages to a temporary location

```sh
wget https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/xUbuntu_18.04/i386/libfaudio0_19.07-0~bionic_i386.deb -O /tmp/faudio_i386.deb
wget https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/xUbuntu_18.04/amd64/libfaudio0_19.07-0~bionic_amd64.deb -O /tmp/faudio_amd64.deb
```

**02:** Install the FAudio packages that you just downloaded

```sh
sudo apt install -y /tmp/faudio_i386.deb
sudo apt install -y /tmp/faudio_amd64.deb
```

## Add the 'deadsnakes' repository

Grapejuice requires at least Python3.7. During the dependency installation we are going to do this. However, we need a
repository that provides Python3.7 since Ubuntu 18.04 and similar distributions only provide up to Python3.6. Run the
following commands and press the enter key when prompted.

```sh
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

## Synchronizing the package repositories

We have to make sure that all repositories and locally installed packages are up to date. Run the following two commands
in a terminal:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Installing Grapejuice dependencies

Grapejuice requires a set of libraries to be installed and to be run. These dependencies can be installed by running the
following command:

```sh
sudo apt install -y gettext git pkg-config python3.7 python3.7-dev python3-pip libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libgtk-3-0 libgtk-3-bin gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gnutls-bin:i386 mesa-utils xdg-utils
```

## Installing Grapejuice

First, you have to aquire a copy of the source code. This is easily done by cloning the git repository.

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice.git
```

After the git clone command is finished, Grapejuice can be installed.

```sh
cd grapejuice
python3.7 ./install.py
```

Once Grapejuice has been installed, you can proceed to the section below.

## üç∑ Installing Wine

**You will need to install Wine before you can use Grapejuice**.
It's recommended to install the patched wine version. Not installing it can lead to crashes, or the in-game cursor not moving properly.
See [this guide](../Guides/Installing-Wine) for instructions on installing the patched Wine build.

## ü§î Still having issues?

Even after installing Grapejuice and the patched wine version above, you may still have issues (examples: bad performance, Roblox not opening, etc). Usually, you can find the solutions here: [Troubleshooting page](../Troubleshooting)
