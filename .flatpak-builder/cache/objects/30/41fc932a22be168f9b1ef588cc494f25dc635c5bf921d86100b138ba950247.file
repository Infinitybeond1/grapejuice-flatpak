title: Install Grapejuice on Debian 10 and similar
---
## Preamble

‚ùì If you didn't click on the guide for Debian, but ended up on this page regardless, please do not panic! Debian is a
distribution that is the base for many other distributions in the Linux landscape. This guide is applicable to the
following distributions:

- Debian 10 (buster)
- Debian 11 (bullseye)
- Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish Indri)
- Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
- LMDE 4 (Debbie)
- Linux Mint 20 (Ulyana)
- Zorin OS 16
- Chrome OS

---

‚ùó This guide assumes that you've properly set up `sudo` on your Debian system.

Don't know what any of that means? If you've installed Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or selected a desktop environment in the
Debian installer, don't worry about this.

---

üíª All commands in this guide should be run in a terminal emulator using a regular user account that has access to `su`
or `sudo`. If you are running a fully fledged desktop environment, you can find a terminal emulator in your applications
menu.

## Synchronise the package repositories

We have to make sure that all repositories and locally installed packages are up to date. Run the following two commands
in a terminal:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Installing curl

The `curl` utility is required for the following step. Run the following command in a terminal:

```sh
sudo apt install -y curl
```

## Downloading Grapejuice's keyring

In order to ensure that the Grapejuice package hasn't been tampered with, you need Grapejuice's keyring.
To download the keyring, run the following commands in a terminal:

```sh
curl https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice/-/raw/master/ci_scripts/signing_keys/public_key.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/grapejuice-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
```

## Adding the Grapejuice repository

The Grapejuice repository needs to be added to your system to get the Grapejuice package.
Run the following command in a terminal:

```sh
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grapejuice.list <<< 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grapejuice-archive-keyring.gpg] https://brinkervii.gitlab.io/grapejuice/repositories/debian/ universal main' > /dev/null
```

## Installing Grapejuice

Since a new repository was added, you need to update package information on your system so apt can find Grapejuice.
Run the following commands in a terminal:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y grapejuice
```

Once Grapejuice has been installed, you can proceed to the section below.

## üç∑ Installing Wine

**You will need to install Wine before you can use Grapejuice**.
It's recommended to install the patched wine version. Not installing it can lead to crashes, or the in-game cursor not moving properly.
See [this guide](../Guides/Installing-Wine) for instructions on installing the patched Wine build.

## ü§î Still having issues?

Even after installing Grapejuice and the patched wine version above, you may still have issues (examples: bad performance, Roblox not opening, etc). Usually, you can find the solutions here: [Troubleshooting page](../Troubleshooting)
