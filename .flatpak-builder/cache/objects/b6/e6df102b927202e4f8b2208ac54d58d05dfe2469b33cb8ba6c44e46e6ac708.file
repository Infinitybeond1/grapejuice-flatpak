:computer: Grapejuice assumes your desktop is configured properly.

## SteamOS 3.0

Before you begin, if you are using SteamOS 3.0, you will need to run `sudo steamos-readonly disable` once you have done
that, you may continue.

## Installing Grapejuice

1. Enable the [multilib repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Official_repositories#multilib).
2. Get an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) or
   [learn how to install packages from the AUR manually](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository).
3. Install the `base-devel` package group with `sudo pacman -S base-devel`.
4. Install [grapejuice-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grapejuice-git/) through an AUR helper or manually.

Once Grapejuice has been installed, you can proceed to the section below.

## Installing dependencies for audio

If you're using Pipewire (check if the `pipewire` process is running), follow
[these instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#PulseAudio_clients).

If you're not using Pipewire, you don't need to do anything.

## üç∑ Installing Wine

**You will need to install Wine before you can use Grapejuice**. It's recommended to install the patched wine version.
Not installing it can lead to crashes, or the in-game cursor not moving properly.
See [this guide](../Guides/Installing-Wine) for instructions on installing the patched Wine build.

## ü§î Still having issues?

Even after installing Grapejuice and the patched wine version above, you may still have issues (examples: bad
performance, Roblox not opening, etc). Usually, you can find the solutions
here: [Troubleshooting page](../Troubleshooting)
